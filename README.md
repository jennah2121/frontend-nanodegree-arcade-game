Udacity: frogger clone 
===============================
Play the game here:  https://jennah2121.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/

This is a frogger clone that I have made as part of Udacity's [Object-oriented Javascript](https://www.udacity.com/course/object-oriented-javascript--ud015) course. 

In it's starting state the game is incomplete. Students are provided with the art assets and the game engine but
must implement the functionatity of the game. The minimum requirements are to:

  1. Add enemies and a player
  2. Implement player movement such that the user can move the player left, right, up and down
  3. Reset the game once the player collides with an enemy, moving the player back to the starting square
  4. Implement winning functionality when the player reaches the water
  
 Please see the the last commit before the first commit created by me to see what code I added. Also see [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/edit) for the instructions provided. I did not 
 receive help with this project. 

Functionality I chose to implement: 

  1. The ability to change character by pressing C on the keyboard
  2. The ability to reset the game at any point by pressing SPACE on the keyboard
  3. A game over screen 
  4. Points tracking (both current score and a high score)
  5. Earning additional points by collecting stars 
  6. An increase in difficulty as the users score increases 
  7. The ability to pause the game by pressing P on the keyboard 
  8. Player lives
